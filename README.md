# Breast Cancer Detection - CNN
This project presents a CNN-based model for early breast cancer detection using MRI data. The model achieved 95% accuracy.

Project Overview:

This project presents a deep learning-based model for the early detection of breast cancer using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was employed to analyze MRI images and classify them as benign or malignant.

Key Features:

- CNN Architecture: A robust CNN model was designed to extract relevant features from MRI images and accurately differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues.
- MRI Data: The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of MRI images, ensuring a diverse and representative training set.
- High Accuracy: The trained model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95% in detecting breast cancer, demonstrating its potential for improving diagnostic outcomes.

Potential Applications:

- Aiding Radiologists: The model can assist radiologists in making more accurate and timely diagnoses, potentially leading to earlier detection and treatment of breast cancer.
- Improving Patient Outcomes: Early detection of breast cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes and increase survival rates.

Technologies Used:

- Python: The primary programming language for implementing the CNN model and data processing.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning frameworks used to build and train the CNN.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI in revolutionizing breast cancer diagnosis and offers a promising avenue for improving patient care.
